# Coupled Hydrology Ecology Simulation System - Parallelized
//  A brief introduction to the "R-RHESSys" model, which is short for rasterized RHESSys model::
//
//  The "R-RHESSys" is developed based on the Regional Hydroecological Simulation Systems (RHESSys, Tague and Band, 2004)
//  but excluded basin, hillslope and zone related hierarchical framework/structure in its predecessor. It also excluded
//  the TOP-MODEL embedded in its predecessor. It is a strictly cell-by-cell-based model and uses spatially explicit
//  routing algorithm to simulate spatial connectivity and movement of water and dissolved nutrients among simulated cells.
//  Since vegetation growth is dynamically simulated, a spin-up simulation control for vegetation growth and associated
//  carbon dynamics was added. This enables users to model vegetation and cycling of C and N in terrestrial ecosystems.
//  In addition, land surface water balance in each cell will be checked before routing water and solutes. The model codes
//  were checked/debugged and greatly simplified compared to the original RHESSys model. In author's personal view, it is
//  easier to handle than its predecessor while most subroutines are kept identical as their counterparts in its
//  predecessor.
//
//  Running R-RHESSys, a potential alternative to the RHESSys, requires the following data:
//
//  First, DEM data and DEM-derived slope, aspect, streams, roads raster data in ArcInfor ASCII format;
//  Second, meteorological data: daily minimum and maximum temperature (in Celsius degree), and precipitation (in meter);
//  Third, annual time-series atmospheric CO2 concentration (in ppm);
//  Fourth, rasterized land-cover, land use or vegetation data to predefine land cover, land use or vegetation types;
//  Fifth, rasterized soil texture class data to predefine soil types for the study region;
//  Finally, a flow table file describes the spatial connectivity of water and nutrients movement among simulated patches.

//  Besides, four default files of patch, soil, vegetation and land-use are provided. These files include parameters
//  relevant to soil, vegetation and land-use that are required to parameterize before running R-RHESSys.

//  As its predecessor, R-RHESSys is able to simulate::
//
//  (i) Land surface hydrology, including river stream flow, base flow, ET, plant transpiration, soil moisture, and etc.
//  (ii) Ecosystem dynamics: vegetation growth and productivity, cycling of carbon and nitrogen (e.g., soil autotrophic
//       and heterotrophic respiration) in terrestrial ecosystems, and etc.
//  (iii) Biogeochemical dynamics:: soil nitrification and denitrification, river nitrate, dissolved DOC and DON,
//       soil mineralization, and etc.
//
//  Note: For simulating land surface hydrology, a least of 20-year spin-up simulations are required for leaf area index
//  to reach stable state. For simulating soil and vegetation carbon, spin-up simulations more than 150 years are required.
//
//  Users are welcome to employ R-RHESSys to regions of their own interests. Examples of model forcing data can be
//  provided for reference or learning. For other questions, please contact the author::
